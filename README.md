## About Hermes

Hermes is the messenger of the gods in Greek mythology. He is the god of trade, heraldry, merchants, commerce, roads, thieves, trickery, sports, travelers, and athletes. He is also the guide of souls to the underworld. By this, Hermes is the perfect name for a library that deals with messages and security.

## Motivation

I just wanted to learn more about JOSE and Go. This project is a way to learn more about both. If you want to make use of this project, please read the license.
